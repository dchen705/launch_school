# Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as arguments. This method should return true if the search value is in the array, false if it is not. You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

# seems way too easy

def include?(arr, value)
  arr.each do |element|
    return true if element == value
  end
  false
end

p include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
p include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
p include?([], 3) == false
p include?([nil], nil) == true
p include?([], nil) == false

# Further exploration: seems like they want you to figure out multiapproaches.
