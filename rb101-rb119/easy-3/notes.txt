# Didn't know how to change a string version of arithmetic operator
# into actual arithmetic operator 

#chat gpt gave a way:
# operator = '+'
# operand1 = 5
# operand2 = 10

# result = operand1.send(operator, operand2)
# puts result

# the actual way to represent arithmetic operator is
# with symbol
# like this
# :+

# reflex algo of meat of problem
# split string into array of characters
# for each character element in array,
# increment an outside intialized counter
# var

# by default, split without arg splits by space delimiter so splits
# string into words. to make split by character, make argument //

# ah answer key good solution, remove the spaces and simply count characters of string.

# daamn not bad
# p "please type a word or multiple words"
# string = gets.chomp
# p "there are #{string.split.join.size} characters in #{string}"

# puts "Please write a word, or multiple words: "

# string = gets.chomp
# chars = string.scan /\S/
# puts "There are #{chars.length} chsracters in #{string}."

# ^ how does that work?
