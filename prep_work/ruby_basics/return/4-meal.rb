# def meal
#   puts 'Dinner'
#   return 'Breakfast'
# end

# puts meal

# Hmm, unsure here. Does the method run even if placed after
# puts. I assume yes because I've seen method placed after
# if statements and used to return boolean.

# Therefore, program prints 'Dinner' then 'Breakfast'?

# Yup

# Answer key further reminded me puts 'Dinner' returns nil
