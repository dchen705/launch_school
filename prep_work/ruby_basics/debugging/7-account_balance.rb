# Time for a check of your financial situation.

# The output of the code below tells you that you have around $70. However, you expected your bank account to have about $238. What did we do wrong?

# Financially, you started the year with a clean slate.

# balance = 0

# # Here's what you earned and spent during the first three months.

# january = {
#   income: [ 1200, 75 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 33.2, 100, 26.9, 78 ]
# }

# february = {
#   income: [ 1200 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 320, 46.7, 122.5 ]
# }

# march = {
#   income: [ 1200, 10, 75 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 350, 12, 59.9, 2.5 ]
# }

# # Let's see how much you've got now...

# def calculate_balance(month)
#   plus  = month[:income].sum
#   minus = month[:expenses].sum

#   plus - minus
# end

# [january, february, march].each do |month|
#   balance = calculate_balance(month)
# end

# puts balance

# Is it because inside the .each loop, rather than culmulatively
# adding into the balance as intended, they just reassign x3, so
# balance just becomes the value returned by calculate_balance()
# on the last iteration of the arrays of months?
