# number = 7

# if number
#   puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
# else
#   puts "I don't have a favorite number."
# end

# prints "My favorite number is 7" because
# a non-zero value is truthy. meaning it evaluates
# to true in a conditional without being true.

# correction: nil is falsy, not 0.
